#Implement a function word_count(s) that, given a string consisting of words separated by spaces. Determine how many words it has. 

#Hint. To solve the problem, use the method count. 

#For example, the result of 
#print(word_count("Such a day is a bad day"))
#must be
#7

def word_count(s):
  count = s.count(" ")
  final_count = count + 1
  return(final_count)

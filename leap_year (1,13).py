#Given the year number. You need to check if this year is a leap year. If it is, print LEAP, otherwise print COMMON.

#The rules in Gregorian calendar are as follows:
#a year is a leap year if its number is exactly divisible by 4 and is not exactly divisible by 100
#a year is always a leap year if its number is exactly divisible by 400

#For example, on input
#2000
#output must be
#LEAP

year = int(input())
if year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0:
  print("LEAP")
else:
  print("COMMON")
